## Introduction

This repository contains a wide range of algorithms and data structures, including but not limited to:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- Data Structures (e.g., Linked List, Binary Tree, Hash Table, Stack, Queue)

Each solution is implemented in Python and is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to enhance understanding. The goal is to serve as a learning resource and a reference for solving algorithmic problems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories based on the type of algorithm or data structure. Each directory contains multiple Python files, each representing a specific problem or solution. The structure is as follows:
